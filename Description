This is my first Python project!
It asks for your username and password, then tells you how long your password is.

How It Works
You enter your username.

You enter your password.

The program prints how many characters are in your password.

Example
What is your username? MoMo  
What is your password? python123  
MoMo, your password python123, is 9 characters long.

How to Run
Open the file in Python (like in VS Code).

Run the program.

Follow the instructions in the terminal.
